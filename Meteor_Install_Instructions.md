# Setting up Journaler
The Journaler software uses the Meteor framework. As a result, there is some extra setup that needs to be done in order to get the software up and running.

## Linux and macOS
In the Terminal, run the following command:
```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```
Navigate the Terminal to the project's root directory, and run the command
```
meteor npm install
```
Once this is complete, start Journaler by running the command
```
meteor
```

These should be all of the steps necessary to get Journaler up and running. If you follow these instructions and the program is still not running, please contact one of the team members and we can help you get it set up:
