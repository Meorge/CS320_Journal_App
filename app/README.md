# Journaler
## Description
This is a basic journaling web application built using Meteor and React. On an account, users may create, modify, and delete entries, and choose to share them with other users.

## Team
- Malcolm Anderson
- Tony Maniscalco
- Chase Jamieson

## Setting up
See `Meteor_Install_Instructions.md` for help setting up Journaler. The Meteor framework should be the only requirement.

## Current Status
As of 16 December 2020, Journaler has reached a stable basic prototype. Users can create, view, modify, and delete entries. Support for sharing entries has not been implemented, but may be in the future.
